Tildesley, originally published by Oxford University Press in 1987. They demonstrate many key algorithms that are foundational to simulation of periodic systems, and have been rereleased in python form for the 2nd edition of the book, which came out in August 2017."

You should add markdown text (like this text!) in a cell above the code to explain any changes you have made; you should add markdown text in a cell following the code to discuss the results and answer the assignment questions."

Then there are 256 lines containing six numbers - these are the x,y,z coordinates of each atom, followed by the x,y,z components of the velocities of each atom.  These are randomly generated to give a distribution that equates to a given temperature (by default, T = 1.0 in Lennard Jones units).\n",
